      <p>If CVs are your thing, here is mine.</p>
      <p>Diego Peralta-Gonzales (he/they) (b. 2000) is a Peruvian composer and sound artist whose work engages with the intersection of sonic materiality, technological mediation, and cultural memory. Deeply informed by both experimental aesthetics and critical theory, his practice investigates how sound can articulate non-linear temporalities, cultural legacies, and complex perceptual frameworks. His current compositional interests center on the integration of algorithmic processes, custom-designed systems in programming environments, and time-based media to construct durational sound environments and multivalent listening experiences. Since 2021, he has pursued studies in composition at The Boston Conservatory at Berklee, working under the guidance of Timothy McCormack, Victoria Cheah, Mischa Salkind-Pearl, and Marti Epstein.</p>
      <p>Aesthetically, his work is characterized by slowness and atmospheric density—favoring durational expanses, microtonal inflection, and noise-based textures that operate outside conventional formal hierarchies. These sonic strategies foreground the subtle and often overlooked aspects of sound, destabilizing normative listening modes. His attention to texture and temporal ambiguity reflects a broader critical engagement with listening as an embodied and politicized act, positioning music not merely as a sonic art form, but as a site of reflection, resistance, and transformation. As a performer of ambient and noise-oriented music, he extends his compositional strategies into live performance contexts, utilizing feedback systems, analog processing, and spatial diffusion to explore emergent sonic behaviors and expanded modes of perception.</p>
      <p>Peralta-Gonzales’s artistic research also engages critically with questions of heritage, epistemology, and cultural memory. Drawing upon Andean cosmologies, histories of resistance, and the sonic memory of place, he approaches these materials not as fixed signifiers of identity, but as dynamic agents in a broader compositional discourse. Rather than treating cultural sources as exoticized or aestheticized referents, he incorporates them through historically situated and contextually rigorous methodologies. In this way, his work aligns itself with broader conversations in postcolonial and decolonial theory, foregrounding complexity, nuance, and critical reflexivity. Sound becomes a medium through which erased or marginalized epistemologies can be rearticulated and reimagined within contemporary experimental practice.</p>
      <p>His work is inherently interdisciplinary, often blurring the lines between composition, sound installation, and audiovisual art. Recent projects incorporate video, generative visual systems, and custom media environments, expanding the temporal and perceptual scope of his compositions. He frequently works with tools such as SuperCollider, Max/MSP, and bespoke analog-digital hybrids, not only for synthesis or processing, but as compositional systems in their own right—frameworks that allow for emergent behaviors, nonlinear forms, and collaborative responsiveness.</p>
      <p>Peralta-Gonzales has presented his work at internationally recognized platforms including the 2025 International Computer Music Conference, SPLICE Festival V, the Divergent Studio at Longy School of Music, and the Summer Institute for Contemporary Performance Practice (SICPP). He has participated in workshops with renowned sound artists, including Daniel Neumann and Michael Schumacher, expanding his engagement with spatial audio, acoustics, and the phenomenology of sound installation. His recent interdisciplinary collaborations include projects with MassArt and the Berklee Interdisciplinary Arts Institute, focusing on audiovisual abstraction and performative media systems that challenge conventional forms of presentation.</p>
      <p>He has composed works for a range of contemporary ensembles and performers, including Splinter Reeds, the Momenta Quartet, the Divergent Quartet, and pianist Yundi Xu. As a former member of the Comunidad Peruana de Música Nueva (CPMN), Diego is interested in contributing to the critical dissemination and development of experimental and contemporary music practices in Peru and the broader Latin American region. His work aims to cultivate sonic practices that engage with situated knowledges and intersecting cultural-historical narratives.</p>

      <h2>"Hidden Layers: who decides when we're entangled" (2025)</h2>
      <p><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> for laptop ensemble</p>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8′</p>
      <p><strong>Written for:</strong> Boston Conservatory at Berklee’s Electronic Music Ensemble</p>
      <p><strong>Program notes:</strong> this piece unfolds as a system under pressure: a networked ecology of sonic control in which autonomy is simulated, fractured, and rerouted through proprietary infrastructures. Sound operates not as expressive content but as procedural residue—routed, modulated, surveilled. The performers operate within partial knowledge: some parameters are exposed yet ungovernable; others remain hidden, accessible only through subversion. This architecture mirrors the epistemic opacity of neural networks—where legible input and output obscure the transformations carried out by intermediary strata. The inclusion of Richard Stallman’s voice, glitched and recontextualized, is neither homage nor critique, but a recursive artifact—a destabilized index of freedom, embedded within the very architectures it disavows. Authorship is unstable, agency entangled, and knowledge unevenly distributed. The patch itself, written in a commercial software environment, encodes the paradox of composing within—and against—closed systems. Crucially, the work is not designed for stability or expressive mastery, but for disorientation. Control is not affirmed but suspended; performers gradually lose sovereignty over their own sound as interdependence metastasizes into opacity. The piece is built to fail—not as error, but as strategy. It is through this collapse that the critique emerges: freedom is not enacted, but withheld; revealed not in resolution, but in the system's recursive breakdown. What remains is not a structure, but a condition: freedom as latency, entanglement as interface, and control as that which falters precisely where it claims to function.</p>

      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 16′ 30″</p>
      <p><strong>Written for:</strong> Luciano Lopez-Parnetti and Gabriel Garza</p>
      <p><strong>Program notes:</strong> Rooted in the spirit of Peru’s rock subterráneo, this piece channels the urgency of a time when music bore witness to collapse—and yet refused to be silenced. It is a call to restore that legacy of resistance in a present moment that often punishes political expression, especially from the left. Through electric guitars and volatile improvisation, the performers navigate uncertainty not as disorder, but as a form of protest—a refusal to be contained. The voice of Pedro Castillo, extracted from the noise of history and embedded in the fixed media, stands as both testimony and indictment: a reminder that democracy, in Peru, remains a fragile promise—one easily revoked when it dares to look like the people it claims to represent.</p>

      <h2>"Retama" (2025)</h2>
      <p><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> for trombone and electronics</p>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> c. 12′ 9″</p>
      <p><strong>Written for:</strong> Mikayla Frank-Martin</p>
      <p><strong>Program notes:</strong> The Retama flower—known in English as Spanish broom—is a flowering species belonging to the Fabaceae family. In Peru the species is viewed as a symbol of the Andean communities throughout the country and is revered as a natural medicine and ornamental throughout the Andes. One of the most famous references to the Retama flower is the protest song written by Ricardo Dolorier in 1970. The song entitled “Flor de Retama” was written about the killing of around 20 students who were protesting rulings made by the Peruvian presidency in Ayacucho in 1969. The song was in response to the violence and government brutality, and the running metaphor throughout the song uses the yellow Retama flowers to describe the deceased community members of Ayacucho. After the song’s release, Flor de Retama became a symbol of the communities residing in the Andes Mountains and is still played in modern-day protests and demonstrations. Retama is not a reflection, but a response—an inward reckoning with loss. It engages memory not as subject matter, but as an active force: a generative mechanism through which the music takes shape. Absence is not depicted; it is inhabited. The piece operates within the threshold where recollection and instinct converge—where grief is not articulated, but enacted. Throughout, traces of the song Flor de Retama emerge as echoes—unresolved, fragmented, embedded—serving less as quotation than as residue. These remnants function as mnemonic triggers, not for the listener, but for the piece itself: memory as structure, not ornament. …because we are also what we have lost.</p>
