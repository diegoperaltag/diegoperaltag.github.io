      <p>Diego Peralta-Gonzales (he/they) (b. 2000) is a Peruvian composer and sound artist whose work engages with the intersection of sonic materiality, technological mediation, and cultural memory. Deeply informed by both experimental aesthetics and critical theory, his practice investigates how sound can articulate non-linear temporalities, cultural legacies, and complex perceptual frameworks. His current compositional interests center on the integration of algorithmic processes, custom-designed systems in programming environments, and time-based media to construct durational sound environments and multivalent listening experiences. Since 2021, he has pursued studies in composition at The Boston Conservatory at Berklee, working under the guidance of Timothy McCormack, Victoria Cheah, Mischa Salkind-Pearl, and Marti Epstein.</p>
      <p>Aesthetically, his work is characterized by slowness and atmospheric density—favoring durational expanses, microtonal inflection, and noise-based textures that operate outside conventional formal hierarchies. These sonic strategies foreground the subtle and often overlooked aspects of sound, destabilizing normative listening modes. His attention to texture and temporal ambiguity reflects a broader critical engagement with listening as an embodied and politicized act, positioning music not merely as a sonic art form, but as a site of reflection, resistance, and transformation. As a performer of ambient and noise-oriented music, he extends his compositional strategies into live performance contexts, utilizing feedback systems, analog processing, and spatial diffusion to explore emergent sonic behaviors and expanded modes of perception.</p>
      <p>Peralta-Gonzales’s artistic research also engages critically with questions of heritage, epistemology, and cultural memory. Drawing upon Andean cosmologies, histories of resistance, and the sonic memory of place, he approaches these materials not as fixed signifiers of identity, but as dynamic agents in a broader compositional discourse. Rather than treating cultural sources as exoticized or aestheticized referents, he incorporates them through historically situated and contextually rigorous methodologies. In this way, his work aligns itself with broader conversations in postcolonial and decolonial theory, foregrounding complexity, nuance, and critical reflexivity. Sound becomes a medium through which erased or marginalized epistemologies can be rearticulated and reimagined within contemporary experimental practice.</p>
      <p>His work is inherently interdisciplinary, often blurring the lines between composition, sound installation, and audiovisual art. Recent projects incorporate video, generative visual systems, and custom media environments, expanding the temporal and perceptual scope of his compositions. He frequently works with tools such as SuperCollider, Max/MSP, and bespoke analog-digital hybrids, not only for synthesis or processing, but as compositional systems in their own right—frameworks that allow for emergent behaviors, nonlinear forms, and collaborative responsiveness.</p>
      <p>Peralta-Gonzales has presented his work at internationally recognized platforms including the 2025 International Computer Music Conference, SPLICE Festival V, the Divergent Studio at Longy School of Music, and the Summer Institute for Contemporary Performance Practice (SICPP). He has participated in workshops with renowned sound artists, including Daniel Neumann and Michael Schumacher, expanding his engagement with spatial audio, acoustics, and the phenomenology of sound installation. His recent interdisciplinary collaborations include projects with MassArt and the Berklee Interdisciplinary Arts Institute, focusing on audiovisual abstraction and performative media systems that challenge conventional forms of presentation.</p>
      <p>He has composed works for a range of contemporary ensembles and performers, including Splinter Reeds, the Momenta Quartet, the Divergent Quartet, and pianist Yundi Xu. As a former member of the Comunidad Peruana de Música Nueva (CPMN), Diego is interested in contributing to the critical dissemination and development of experimental and contemporary music practices in Peru and the broader Latin American region. His work aims to cultivate sonic practices that engage with situated knowledges and intersecting cultural-historical narratives.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “And this I dreamt, and this I dream,<br>
        And some time this I will dream again,<br>
        And all will be repeated, all be re­embodied,<br>
        You will dream everything I have seen in dream.<br>
        To one side from ourselves, to one side from the world<br>
        Wave follows wave to break on the shore,<br>
        On each wave is a star, a person, a bird,<br>
        Dreams, reality, death – on wave after wave.<br>
        No need for a date: I was, I am, and I will be,<br>
        Life is a wonder of wonders, and to wonder<br>
        I dedicate myself, on my knees, like an orphan,<br>
        Alone – among mirrors – fenced in by reflections:<br>
        Cities and seas, iridescent, intensified.<br>
        A mother in tears takes a child on her lap.”<br>
        — Arseny Tarkovsky

      <p><strong>Program notes:</strong> The imperious need for stillness to escape from reality and seek tranquility. Feeling that only “our” time stands still. To be able to see more clearly what is happening and what surrounds us. Feel every blow, every breeze, every hit. Closing our eyes, stop at the sound and feel it carefully. To feel its birth, its evolution, its death, its nature. A moment of trance that is abruptly cut off by reality and our consciousness… What is it that makes the floods seem still?</p>
